# Auto Layout 101 - iOSDevUK

##Â Demo App

This is a demo app for my Auto Layout 101 session from iOSDevUK. It's a simple
survival guide for conference attendees who are visiting Wales for the first
time. 

It demonstrates a number of Auto Layout features:

* Laying out view controllers with Auto Layout (see `WordsDetailViewController`)
* Animations in Auto Layout (also in `WordsDetailViewController`)
* Self-sizing table view cells (in `PlacesViewController`)
* Scrollviews in Auto Layout (in `PlacesDetailViewController`)
